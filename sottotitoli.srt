00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
What is good everyone welcome to today's charting session today is Sunday January 26th, 2025

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,160
Tabia going over well this week's price action the trades that we ended up taking

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,420
And yeah, let's get into it. So Monday was a bank holiday. So I'm gonna skip over Monday

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Let's just get straight into

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,400
Tuesday

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Which is right here? I am

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
All right, so coming into Tuesday

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,640
Let's just pull up the daily bias and

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,000
What I was looking at coming into Tuesday

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,399
Tuesday was what the 21st

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,560
So we had around a 300 point move during age of session

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,320
So I was expecting a lot of choppiness during New York

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,840
This was a really really bad week and the common theme of this week was just bad am and then good PM price action

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,680
So I was trading a lot of PM session. I think I took

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,920
Two days or I traded PM session so we'll go over PM session because that's where I took you know

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
That's why I made the majority of profits this week

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,560
But yeah, so just bad am and there was really good PM session this week

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Just doing the work with New York like this is what happens when you see age of session have like a three-in-a-point move

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,159
You're gonna expect New York to chop and then PM be good, which is what happened almost every day this week

20
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,079
So yeah, we had this nice SMT. I wasn't really leaning any any way

21
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,159
I'm still bullish and the whole entire week. I was extremely bullish

22
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:43,319
Being that we were just trending up towards all-time highs. Yes had a lot of that low resistance liquidity that we were looking at

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,280
So it was a really obvious draw higher

24
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,340
We just kept having these SMTs but without any structure to validate going lower

25
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:59,079
So the majority of my daily biases I sent out this week was just still bullish until there's a clear flip in that order flow

26
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,200
Okay, so Tuesday, I don't think I took any trades. Let's just

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
Check this out though

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
Yeah, we did take it pretty given

29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
So this is the first trade we took

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,920
We ended up going lower at open there was that bearish bias towards London there was that London Judas right

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,420
London lows didn't really train to anything significant that sponsor this move so

32
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,460
That was a pretty obvious strong liquidity and then from there you could expect

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,300
Along from off that which is what we were looking for right so we got that short at open with no entry

34
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,939
And then after that we ended up getting this really clean form in an IFG

35
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,580
And price action for the most part ended up looking super clean

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,659
I ended up getting a fill around here and then I ended up going break even

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,379
Once we hit this high here and then we also had an unfilled 15-minute gap

38
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,620
So this was a mech model up to the 15-minute gap right up here

39
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,780
Unfortunately this ended up getting stopped at a break even I think had he ended up taking

40
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,659
some TP

41
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:20,219
And it did eventually end up hitting this was just super super slow delivery really just choppy delivery

42
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,300
And not good PA whatsoever and a pity I'm like 12 o'clock

43
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,300
So like definitely a horrible price action

44
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,139
Again, this is like a common theme where we'll see really really bad price action during AM and then good price action in PM

45
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,259
So yes, the draw did end up hitting I'm not holding through this though

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:49,459
But yeah, I don't know just being a break even trade overall and I don't think I took any PM trades on Tuesday

47
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,459
So let's just get into the next day if anyone has any questions on this data

48
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,819
It was a good I

49
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,939
Didn't get breakeven nice

50
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,259
I held through it that's crazy

51
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,019
At 157 what happened I 157

52
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,019
I

53
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:45,319
Was a trade a little long nice I don't think I took this

54
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,459
Did I take this

55
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,180
No

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,019
Looks good though nice low-long probably break even our TP one all right

57
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
And SMT is a

58
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,259
Is a divergence between assets so I'm Q and ES they move correlated

59
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:17,340
One there's let's say this low gets taken on NQ and ES doesn't take that low and it's maybe up here

60
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,780
And that's an SMT divergence, but yeah, definitely look at that T trades video. It's a

61
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,379
It's a good video explaining SMTs

62
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,300
Okay, let's go into next day. This is one day again

63
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,980
Just still delivering bullish. We are still just disrespecting these SMTs still trending higher

64
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,459
And there was really no delivery lower which is why I really didn't like any sort of shorts this whole week

65
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,980
Because I was still bullish and there's nothing really for me to tell me otherwise, okay?

66
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,379
So coming into Wednesday again, I think I was bullish again on Wednesday

67
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,899
Yeah, bullish bias today we had this SMT

68
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,939
So what I expected from this SMT is for us to maybe have some sort of

69
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:08,159
Rebalance of the range maybe some sort of CI ST trade down a London lows then get some delivery off of that the same way

70
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:13,980
We got it on the day before and on Tuesday where we had that sell off and then we got the long off of one and lows

71
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,779
I kind of want to see that exact thing happen again

72
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,379
because it also was in this kind of

73
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,659
Volume and balance that I wanted to see get traded back to so

74
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:29,459
That's what I was looking at at open. I wanted to see oh wait. I'm looking at something else right here

75
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:35,500
Yeah, I just kind of wanted to see that rebalance of the range. It was kind of just awkward positioning of

76
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,939
Where we were

77
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:43,980
but yeah, I wanted to see an open low high close being that we had all this generated cell sila liquidity, right?

78
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580
We ended up opening and

79
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Not really having a good

80
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,700
Open low high close being that we just took this out in pre-market and then 930 ended up distributing and

81
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,180
Yeah, the only setup I saw really was this long here

82
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,980
There was this long this was pretty good. We traded into a five-minute

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
breaker block right here

84
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,220
We also had like just yeah the CISD right this was overall a good long

85
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,420
I did just want to see another manipulation down to this five-minute gap

86
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:27,740
And I know if I was like industry and I took this long I would have been like super soft stop by this unfold five-minute

87
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,180
Even though we did trade it to three minute. I just want to see another manipulation

88
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,819
Anyways didn't get it

89
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,699
Not this is not like a good setup. I don't think and then this long here was another good setup

90
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,259
But we left equal lows right here. So

91
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:51,060
Just leaving spread apart equal lows like this is not good. I don't like longing against that

92
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,939
So yeah, I didn't end up taking a long here. We ended up having this inversion for all you got right here

93
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,899
And again, I'm not taking this because we left those equal lows, right?

94
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,419
And that I ended up playing out though

95
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,259
And then here's the short that I wanted to take so this was actually a really good short

96
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,860
I was about to take it. We ended up having just a pretty nice mech model

97
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:19,659
I think we swept out this biceye liquidity here on ES. So we had like a nice SMT

98
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:26,779
And then we had some sort of unfilled 15-minute below us and we also had equal lows, right?

99
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,860
So we had these equal lows right here, which was this unfilled 30-minute and we also had these equal lows here

100
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,179
So overall like this was the short setup I was looking at I didn't end up taking this because

101
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:45,579
It just took way too long like you guys have to understand and remember this is why this is also why just journaling is so important

102
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:50,779
When you journal you remember not only like the losing trades, which is so important

103
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:58,139
But you remember the winning trades like you remember how good price action can be and you remember how good delivery can actually be

104
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:06,699
Right, it's like that three-kandal pattern formation of an inversion of making the gap and then inverting right after like you know what good price action looks like

105
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,060
Right

106
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,259
So when you're just like oh like debating whether this setup is good

107
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,020
It takes like 30 candles to invert it is like most likely not right this took

108
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,620
So long to just invert some one-minute bearish gap. We just left low resistance liquidity like not good delivery

109
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,860
Not good price action whatsoever really really trash am session

110
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,300
And yeah, just overall not not not not anything good

111
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,899
um

112
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,059
And yeah, so that's hot. Does anyone have any questions for this day?

113
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,859
I did not end up taking this short here

114
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,659
But so I don't have any questions

115
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,179
Is it relevant if we make equal lows on an cube and not m and q?

116
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,899
Only relevant on an q. I wouldn't focus on m and q ever just only for entries really

117
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,419
um

118
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,259
There's gonna be a lot of times to

119
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,860
Dude if you're if you're someone who actively trades on m and q

120
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,779
Just make sure you're always looking at the nq chart. There's also been times where like

121
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,860
um

122
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,100
And q will fucking inverse and m and q won't buy like a take and it'll throw you off a lot

123
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,620
And then yeah, only focus on like equal lows and equal highs on nq. So yeah

124
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,059
Yeah, I can try to add some on q and surround you

125
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,259
Yeah, let me check out 1223

126
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,100
1223 you said there was a set up

127
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,179
I don't really trade lunch hour, but let's see

128
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
On full 15 minute here

129
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,539
Lot of chop

130
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
What was the set up

131
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,259
23

132
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Oh right here short right here

133
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,259
Not bad. Yeah, not about short

134
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,500
Um

135
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,340
All right, so now I ended up taking two trades in am session there was some

136
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:11,899
There's there's no best time frame for a c i cd just as long as you're using time frame alignment. That's all that matters um

137
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,899
So right on my mouth bro

138
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Let's type in that john out

139
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,539
so

140
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,700
I ended up taking these two trades in pm session

141
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,220
Um, this was the first trade I ended up taking I ended up taking this long here

142
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
So what I was looking at

143
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,580
Really was we had this we were still inside of this hourly for valigat and we're inside of this hourly order block

144
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,300
So what I could have waited for really really is just the test into the opening price of this order block

145
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,379
Um, and maybe that's why I got stopped on this first trade

146
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,379
but

147
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,140
but um

148
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,139
Yeah, overall I like to set up a lot again

149
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,699
We're inside of that hourly for valigat hourly order block

150
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,659
Um, we also had like these equal lows right here and then we swept them and then we just got like a immediate momentum off of this

151
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,899
And then we had triple equal highs and an unfilled five minutes so this was just like textbook textbook setup

152
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,179
um

153
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,220
The only thing I didn't like was again that hourly order block

154
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:19,819
So I went in a little bit lower risk on this first trade because I did see potential

155
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
For it to go lower

156
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,180
Um, I ended up getting stopped out pretty much immediately on this first trade um, and then we hit the hourly order block

157
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,180
Like I expected and then I reentered longs right here at the retest of this or I think just at this close

158
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,500
um

159
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,379
With the stop loss here for a 1-0 1.71RR

160
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,300
so

161
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,260
I ended up taking this long right here and then ended up playing out and this was also turned out to be an unfilled 15 minute

162
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,060
So yeah, just like overall really really good long

163
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,100
Um, how come you took two trades in a day showing you normally just stick to one or is it dependent on what you get on the day

164
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:08,540
Yeah, good question. So I um trade one to two I take one to two trades sometimes one to four one to three usually like um

165
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,980
I don't limit myself to one traded day

166
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,380
I used to when I was just like kind of unprofitable and still a beginner in the markets

167
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,139
And I always do suggest that for people to stick with one trade a day

168
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,220
Um, and you always hear me telling like beginner traders like do trade like one trade a day is really all you need

169
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,899
Um, because anything after that I feel like a lot of people just get

170
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,659
Super emotional um, there's a bunch of emotions that get built up

171
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:38,059
Um, when you take more than one trade a day, but since you know, I've been trading for a while now

172
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:38,939
I don't

173
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:43,100
Obviously I saw the motions, but it's very different where I'm able to actually manage them

174
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:50,300
So no, I don't limit myself to just one traded day as long as I see my model and see my setup present itself

175
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,180
I'll take it um, but I do like to take only two trades a day high quality setups

176
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:02,220
Um, yeah, I I won't my I have a max loss limit of um, 1% so

177
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,580
For when I'm like building and that depends on like where I am overall, but

178
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,860
Yeah, there's days where like price action is pretty slow things aren't like delivery

179
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,820
Powerfully I guess so you'll probably go low risk and you can take two to three trades

180
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,460
Um, but then there's days where it's good volatility price action is moving fucking great

181
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,860
Drama like we used clear everything is playing out and your first trade will be a bang and you can just call it there

182
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,700
So

183
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:34,540
I just I just typed it out, but I think like one way to see it is like on good days you want to be able to capitalize of course

184
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,379
And then on mid days, you know try to avoid taking too many trades and chasing profits. So

185
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,779
Yeah

186
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,540
Okay

187
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Let's get into ones they know

188
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:47,740
Um

189
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,620
Wednesday or no, that was just one say it's Thursday

190
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,820
Okay

191
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,340
All right

192
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,500
This is the 23rd

193
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:08,620
All right, so Thursday I did have again a sh just a bullish bias, but again the trend of the whole entire week was

194
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,019
I just wanted to see that manipulation lower at open and we just kept we're we just weren't

195
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,379
Getting that we just kept like just distributing it open, but again, I was looking to see this AMD

196
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,740
Accumulation, I wanted to see manipulation at open and then distribute to London highs

197
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,420
Um, and it was bullish overall, but I had this kind of short-term bearish bias

198
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,700
Um towards that previous day low and towards less London lows just any area here

199
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,700
Um, I'm looking to see an AMD at open taking out those levels and then distribute higher to those data highs and higher

200
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:43,259
So that's what I was looking at um

201
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,140
And

202
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,820
When I was

203
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,900
Yeah, so at open that's exactly what I was looking at right we ended up having more accumulation here

204
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,940
And then at open and this had to be I think the worst price action day I've ever seen in my life

205
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,500
um

206
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,620
Not gonna lie like I this was like astonishing like how bad this was just super fucking

207
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,420
choppy there was Trump speaking at 11

208
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,900
um

209
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,379
But yeah, that was pretty much it there there was one setup like one setup here

210
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,660
That was that I actually was going to take and it was this short

211
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,540
Um, but again, we took 30 candles to invert this gap and then we left equal highs right here

212
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,220
Just like really bad setup. So no, this was just

213
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
nothing good um

214
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
And then we didn't even take out this cell side

215
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,460
And then we just traded higher traded lower trade higher. I mean, there's really nothing to commentate about this

216
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,300
But

217
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,540
What I was looking for then was again, London high so we ended up not manipulating lower and that's fine

218
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
Um, but we did end up creating this 15 minute bullish gap

219
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,140
Um, leaving behind a condition right so this is the first gap we left the whole session

220
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,700
And this was a great condition right if we respect it and we get lower time for him structure out of it

221
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,740
Then where should we go London highs like I expected and then if we disrespect it then we could go lower and then maybe get a PM long

222
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,580
So that's what I was really looking at um once Trump started speaking

223
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:29,259
I there was like a lot of like random candles random volatility happening happening really obviously horrible choppy price action

224
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,140
so I risked

225
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,460
200 or I think $300 on this trade

226
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,540
Um, there was a long setup right here that actually did like a lot um and I'm getting stopped out of this for $300

227
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,780
um, and this was again that same that really it was a really nice setup to London highs and previous day high

228
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,500
ended up hitting but I'll show you what it was is that

229
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,420
We ended up trading here one minute CISD we got an inversion for value app right here

230
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,740
And I wanted to see London highs and higher

231
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,339
I had a stop loss just at this breaker block right here

232
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,579
so

233
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,900
Yeah, I just ended up getting stopped out. I didn't want to put it all the way down at the wick. It just

234
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,779
That's just like it was just way too big of a stop the breaker block if your bullish should hold

235
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,579
But since we were so choppy and since the delivery was so bad and I've getting stopped out

236
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:21,579
I think I might have

237
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
No, I think yeah, I just got stopped out

238
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,500
And then from there price did end up running and we did end up going all the way to the higher targets

239
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,900
But let's just go into the second trade I took the day on the day

240
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,099
And it was again in PM session because of how much cleaner

241
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:43,339
Just look how much better this price action is just like so much better than there's this choppy shit

242
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:48,859
But uh first off before I move on just I don't have any questions on the this lost Isaac

243
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay, looks like we're good um, so let's just get into PM then because I didn't I did end up taking a trade in PM session

244
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,059
um, we ended up having a really nice SMT at this high at the internal highs

245
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,259
Then we also had an SMT with the external highs right here to an SMT with this high and then also these highs here

246
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:28,779
So it was really nice. There was a previous day high SMT as well as internal high SMT

247
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,819
And it was just a very simple mech model. We had an unfilled 50 minute gap right here. I posted this trade

248
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,660
um

249
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,460
And it was a four minute iFG

250
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,379
So we had a four minute iFG here. I waited for retest

251
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,339
Um, and then I ended up getting filled right there. I didn't hold all the way down here

252
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,740
I ended up just closing there because it was a one to two rr

253
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,220
And I just needed that amount of profit to secure payout. I think I closed more around here something

254
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Um, but yeah, this was just the trade I took

255
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,380
Zero drawdown. I top ticked this shit. It was beautiful

256
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,539
Um, I'm going to the crazy shit I'm gonna see in my life. Yeah, so this was that I don't think I've ever actually seen that like

257
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:15,339
Literally not even a singular tick. Yeah, I showed that show is beautiful

258
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
But yeah, I was just off of the four minute

259
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Um

260
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,860
Um, and am such an price end up going to Asia highs, but in terms of

261
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,620
Getting all confluence is satisfied. You think Asia highs left is fine or no?

262
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,059
Um

263
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,339
I don't really understand your question what do you mean

264
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,980
In terms of getting all confluence is satisfied

265
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,859
What do you mean

266
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:21,579
You guys beginner when you get these conditions choppy and am

267
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:27,179
Um, do you suggest staying only to am and not taking traders at a kid to try to PM?

268
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,139
um

269
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,699
Yeah, I'm just what David probably did so back dust

270
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,779
Persevere

271
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:38,699
But um, yeah, usually if again if am's choppy PM will be clean

272
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,179
But the whip is stop loss like a rule

273
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
I don't know

274
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Oh my god

275
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
What's the squirk to the game?

276
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Fuck

277
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,700
Um

278
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,620
Like London high-hat you have your confluence is iFG etc

279
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,299
Would you wait for Asian highs to get here? Just so for the short since we already took all of that by side

280
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:22,059
I don't know what maybe you're looking like Asia highs. I don't care about any buy start level like here because we took it all

281
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:24,059
I think that's some tea was all the way here

282
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,019
There was a huge SMT with the previous day high

283
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:32,700
So there was no need for price to go higher here when we had this unfilled 15 minute gap right here, right?

284
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,460
So

285
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,619
On that tree took intermediate low. Yeah, but I don't care since we didn't take the draw the draw on the quid

286
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,619
It was still this and also lower could I have held till here sure um

287
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,299
But one to two hours on you to make red

288
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,219
Um when looking for retests like this trade we need to see first like the intermediate

289
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,179
Um at all, I mean it's really just screen time, but like

290
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,699
Like there's times where I'll go break even if the enemy it lowers take it and there's times where I won't

291
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,099
There's times where you know not take the trade if the enemy it lowers take and there's times where I will

292
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,899
um

293
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:12,539
Like as long as the the draw is not taken like for example here like what I was mainly looking

294
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,099
I was the 15 minute gap. I don't really care about anything else as long as 15 minute gap is not traded to then it's still valid for a mech model

295
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:20,779
um

296
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,059
so yeah

297
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,019
Why didn't you hold the equal lows because I just needed this amount of money to get a payout so

298
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,539
um

299
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,659
And it was a one to two are I didn't need anything more than that

300
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:38,459
Um on that short I targeted the accumulation lows

301
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,900
Again, yeah, it's taking some sort of wick liquidity always a requirement for your model

302
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,700
Key levels also work. Yeah, I just I just use key levels

303
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
um

304
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
What stopped you from over trading um

305
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,259
um

306
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,620
I mean there's not really like one like again there there wasn't like one thing that stopped me from over trading

307
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
I guess it was just

308
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:16,220
A lot of like years of just that should happening where I would keep trying it and it wouldn't work and then just got to a point where it's like

309
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
You know that the market

310
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,500
The money you make when you over trade is not yours. It's gonna get you're gonna give it right back to the markets eventually

311
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,259
um

312
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,539
No matter like oh my god

313
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,180
Well, I made money and I made the money back on this day

314
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,819
So I should try to get the next day. It's like that mindset and that mentality is never gonna work

315
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,980
So just knowing that you know the that money's not yours and to stop treating it like it is

316
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:44,379
So

317
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,619
Yeah, I mean, I'm just just

318
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:52,379
It was just years of fucking I was a year of straight up not following my rules. I got sick and tired of it

319
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,019
Um

320
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:57,259
Buddy just skip it's cuz I just answered that question

321
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,179
Do you think 2023 had shitty p.a. In compared to 2024

322
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,939
Because I'm back to you in 2023 and I found it very abstract

323
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,059
Um

324
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,740
No, I don't I don't think so I think 20 anything was really good

325
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:18,299
I've I've backed us to the majority of 2023 and the recording stop so you can check it out there

326
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,259
Um

327
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,500
Okay, let's go into the next and final day

328
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,179
Which was right right here

329
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:44,539
All right, so Friday this was actually this was the best pa we got all week

330
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,659
Um

331
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:53,019
Yeah, this was the best pa we've gone all week which was this there was really good setups actually

332
00:25:53,179 --> 00:26:01,579
So first being this short we had a really beautiful short um an am session or we had a bunch of generation of lr

333
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,819
l

334
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:10,139
Um, we had these equal highs here and we also had a really really clean SMT with previous a high so

335
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:15,980
At open we ended up trading higher and it up taking out those highs and

336
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,460
up forming that bearish SMT

337
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:25,500
And then we ended up getting a few trades so there was this one minute short here. It wasn't my favorite um

338
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:30,220
The one that I did really like though and this was also because there was 10 am news

339
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:31,980
um

340
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,539
The short of the day had to have been

341
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,420
Right here. So this was definitely like the best play all week to be honest

342
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,900
This five minute ifg. I did not end up taking this for a lot of reasons

343
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:51,819
Number one is I was just overall still bullish yes was extremely close to just all not extremely close all time highs

344
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:56,620
But it was like right up here and yes had like a bunch of lr right here

345
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,259
Um, so I was just overall bullish

346
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,700
I did of course want to see this play happen to then take a long

347
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:05,819
Which is what I've been you know waiting for the whole entire time

348
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,740
But I just wasn't that confident that we had a five minute ifg and then we also still held this volume imbalance right here

349
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,900
So definitely it was a little bit sus we are also inside of a 15 minute gap right here

350
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,339
um

351
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,339
We also had data highs right here

352
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,140
Just a lot of influences for me to not take the trade

353
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:28,700
But in hindsight could I have taken it just based on draw on liquidity? Yes um and regarding everything else yes

354
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:34,619
Because it was in place for a really really nice sell and a really good short and overall it was a really good play

355
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,339
So this was definitely a really good short to take

356
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,019
Um, but then the play right after um

357
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:48,859
Damn, who is the guy that said this short snuck this long after is not gonna work when we were waiting for our long

358
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,259
I we took the screenshot. Yeah, I need to find it. I need to find it

359
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:56,619
That bro was on

360
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:03,500
His fucking bro. He was like super convinced. I was not gonna play out. I just being shot at that shit too. I had it on my screen

361
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,859
It wasn't Eric

362
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,259
I was an Eric it wasn't Eric

363
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,419
You find it really quick

364
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:15,099
I can't find it

365
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,659
Main screenshots and act just like disappear, bro

366
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,379
Damn

367
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:24,619
Yeah, there it is

368
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,219
Father David

369
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:32,779
Look at this fucker. Longs aren't gonna play out. Oh, and he's in chat. Bro was mad quiet. Wow

370
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,979
Yeah, and I buddy signal bought the dealer too

371
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:42,059
Anyways

372
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:46,059
Um, okay, so there was a few setups we were looking at

373
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,979
Um, this was the first long that I was gonna take

374
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,299
This was the long right here. We had a woman at ifg

375
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,619
Um

376
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:01,819
Yeah, there was a lot of stuff here, okay, first was like one minute, but there was a three minute

377
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,059
So I was waiting for the three minutes to get inverted

378
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,379
Um, and I'm getting inverted and then the clothes was just yeah, that's that's just a high estrogen

379
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:11,579
entry right there a high testosterone requires one minute

380
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,219
I saw the one minute didn't care to check all their time frames. All right. Wow. Was that on purpose?

381
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:23,179
Yeah, for sure buddy. Yeah, I purposely took the one minute and definitely

382
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,100
knew that there's a four minute no, it doesn't matter

383
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,019
But then there was that retracement into rebounds which um

384
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,620
I went in on all my accounts, but one account I scaled in

385
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Actually, one account. I only went in at that rebounds right there, which was fucking beautiful

386
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:47,259
Um, and that was a good one. It's like Blake said last time when when was it bro? We took a trade and you were saying that

387
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
You didn't like that we just

388
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
Sort of aggressively ran through

389
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,220
The inversion and we most likely retraced blah blah blah and you don't want to go break even now awesome motion

390
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,220
But yeah, when you have those leg ups like that

391
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,460
uh, like for example that inversion with just a lot of upcoding candles and you have that really bullish leg

392
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,900
Uh, chances are you'll probably get a rebounds and you can get like some equal every um entry

393
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,180
So down was nice and then Blake took the inversion right after that which is solid is

394
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,700
You broke your rules and not trading 11. Okay

395
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
That's just

396
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,500
All right, he's he's rage baby. I know he's rage baby. He's rage okay. I'm a I'm a guy

397
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
I need to watch this fucking bills again

398
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,940
Okay, then after that um, I took a two-minute long

399
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Taking this two minutes to unfilled 15 to the unfilled gap

400
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,619
This was based off of we traded back into this three-minute ifg

401
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,420
We ended up getting a

402
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,940
bounce off of that two-minute was right here the close on this also ended up being pretty horrendous

403
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,740
So I waited for a retrace got my retrace

404
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,099
Um, then I ended up being under the demon. I think I closed I did close a little bit earlier because there was an SMT

405
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,059
Ended up playing out for about that one to one or rather

406
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,500
So really nice trade in am session um

407
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,619
I'm sorry like just on friday. This was just the best price action we got all week

408
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:21,740
Which is pretty funny being how shit and slow the delivery was but to be honest like

409
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,460
This was the best price action we got in all week the most amount of setups I've seen um and that's that

410
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:34,220
Does anyone have any questions on this trigger here?

411
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:42,140
But it was butter

412
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,380
All right, let me get into the shibby all right, why'd you take it past 11 anytime a.m. Generates liquidity and doesn't need draw

413
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,580
11 a.m. will typically go ahead and run it. Uh, it's as simple as that

414
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,580
It's not just like we don't just trade 11 for fun to trade 11 um no

415
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,940
a.m. lack of delivery 11 a.m. will typically cook

416
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,500
So just a little thing to be

417
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,260
Iying out if you ever see you know a.m. Doesn't really deliver to draw

418
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,300
You can stay on for another 20 30 minutes and see if something presents off starting 11 a.m. simple as that

419
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,460
um

420
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Cool cool. Yeah, I'm not required
